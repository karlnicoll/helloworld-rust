# Hello, world! (In Rust)

Don't expect anything interesting here. This is just a repository containing my
first journey into Rust development. It is literally the code from the Rust
book.

## Building

```shell
$ rustc main.rs
```

## Running

After building, run `.\main.exe` (Windows) or `./main` (non-Windows).
